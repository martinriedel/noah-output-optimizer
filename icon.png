# Icon Placeholder
# 
# For a proper Home Assistant add-on, you should add an icon.png file (512x512 pixels recommended)
# This file serves as a placeholder - replace with an actual PNG icon for your add-on
#
# The icon will be displayed in the Home Assistant add-on store
# Consider using battery/energy-related imagery for the Noah battery optimizer
